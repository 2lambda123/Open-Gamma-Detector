# Open Scintillation Counter

Open hardware for a simple all-in-one scintillation counter design using a popular NaI(Tl) scintillation crystal.

Hardware design has been done in EasyEDA and all the needed files for you to import the project as well as
a schematic can be found in the hardware folder. There is also a gerber file available for direct pcb manufacturing.

Software aims to be as simple as possible to understand and maintain; to achieve this I decided to use an off-the-shelf
microntroller - the Adafruit ItsyBitsy M4 Express. This board can be programmed over micro USB and is powerful (fast)
enough for the purpose.

More info will follow shortly.
