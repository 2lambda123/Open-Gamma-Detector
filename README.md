# Open Scintillation Counter

## !Note: This repo is still very much work in progress. I am currently working on finishing this project.

Open hardware for a simple, yet powerful, all-in-one scintillation counter design using a popular NaI(Tl)
scintillation crystal. Can be used for gamma spectroscopy while being much cheaper than any off-the-shelf platform.

Hardware design has been done mainly in EasyEDA and all the needed files for you to import the project as well as
a schematic can be found in the `electronics` folder. There is also a gerber file available for direct PCB manufacturing.

Software aims to be as simple as possible to understand and maintain; to achieve this I decided to use an off-the-shelf
microntroller - the quite new Raspberry Pi Pico. This board can be programmed over micro USB and is powerful (i.e. fast)
enough for the purpose and also pretty cheap.

## Hardware

**To do: Add PCB images.**

**Note: The schematic is outdated, the most recent version will be here shortly.**

This project utilizes a silicon photomultiplier (short SiPM) which is way smaller and more robust than a traditional photomultiplier
tube and does not need a high-voltage supply. I'll link some in-depth datasheets about this particular SiPM:

* [C-Series SiPM Sensors datasheet](https://www.onsemi.com/pdf/datasheet/microc-series-d.pdf)
* [Linearity of the Silicon Photomultiplier](https://www.onsemi.com/pub/Collateral/AND9776-D.PDF)
* [Introduction to the SiliconPhotomultiplier (SiPM)](https://www.onsemi.com/pub/Collateral/AND9770-D.PDF)
* [Biasing and Readout of ON Semiconductor SiPM Sensors](https://www.onsemi.com/pub/Collateral/AND9782-D.PDF)

This project consists of two PCBs - one carrier board for the SiPM (`electronics/sipm` folder) that will be mounted on top of
your scintillation crystal. It will then be connected to the other board: the main detector (`electronics/detector` folder)
which includes amplification, pulse detection and energy measurement.

The heart of the detector board is the [Raspberry Pi Pico](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-pico/) which uses its (calibrated)
ADC to measure the pulse amplitude (e.g. the energy) immediately after an event occurs (using an interrupt).

## Software

### Raspberry Pi Pico

The Arduino IDE sketch can be found in `/arduino`.

To program the Pico with the Arduino IDE, you will need the following board configs:

* [Arduino-Pico](https://github.com/earlephilhower/arduino-pico)

In addition, I wrote my own little library to calibrate the Pico's ADC using a simple linear calibration which is also used in the sketch:

* [Arduino-Pico-Analog-Correction](https://github.com/Phoenix1747/Arduino-Pico-Analog-Correction)

### PC

I'm currently working on my own version of an Web-MCA designed to allow uploading custom gamma spectrum data and also use the
detector output directly to do some live-plotting. More info will follow.

## Example measurements

Data will follow when the new detector is ready.

|Sample Material|Average counts per seconds (cps)|
|:------:|:-----------------------------------------:|
|Background radiation, no sample|todo|
|Am-241 (**still inside**) a regular smoke detector (0.9 micro curies)|todo|
|5.2g LYSO scintillator (Lu-176!) |todo|
|Uranium glaze on an electric plug (~1930/40s)|todo|
|Wristwatch with Radium dials|todo|
|Pitchblende (amount unknown)|todo|

## Documentation

A link to the comprehensive documentation will follow. Please be patient, this is **a lot** of work :)

It will also include the following...

### Limitations and Ideas

#### Cooling the SiPM

During operation all the electronics including the photomultiplier naturally slightly heat up. Due to the analysis hardware being connected only by a couple of wires in some (if low) distance all of it's heat shouldn't affect the SiPM PCB really. Also due to the SiPM being connected to a rather big copper area of the PCB it's heat too should not increase the temperature much over ambient (if at all that is). So air or water cooling alone won't improve performance significantly. However, one could cool the SiPM PCB with a peltier module to sub-ambient temperatures. SensL already provides peltier-cooled SiPMs with their [MiniSM](https://www.sensl.com/downloads/ds/DS-MiniSM.pdf) series of sensor modules. According to their [datasheet AND9770 (Figure 27)](https://www.onsemi.com/pub/Collateral/AND9770-D.PDF) every 10Â°C reduction in temperature decreases the dark count rate by 50%!

#### Shielding Background Radiation

Shielding the ambient background can be done ideally using a wide enough layer of lead (bricks) all around the detector. The SiPM and the sample can then be put into the structure to get the best measurements possible. But be sure to get "clean" lead with a low enough percentage of isotopes if you can as they too can be radioactive and introduce even more radiation to the system.
